# Second Stump Tooling
This directory contains a bunch of tools that I wrote to help me during development, these aren't really related to the main project but I didn't feel right just throwing them out.

### [inspectThreshold.py](tools/inspectThreshold.py)
`inspectThreshold.py` takes in a command line argument of a video file. It then inspects the file with SceneDetect's threshold detector and outputs a graph with the results.

### [installDocker.sh](tools/installDocker.sh)
`installDocker.sh` does exactly what it says on the tin, just makes sure that Docker is fully installed on the system.
